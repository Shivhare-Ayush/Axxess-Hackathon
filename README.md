# 🚀 AI-Powered Immersive Agent Platform

![Platform Preview](dashboard/frontend/public/prelude.png)

**An immersive AI platform that combines multi-agent systems, real-time 3D visualization, and cloud-native infrastructure to simulate intelligent coordination in dynamic environments.**

This project demonstrates how modern AI agents can collaborate, reason, and orchestrate decisions in a mission-based simulation environment. It integrates multimodal AI, distributed agent communication, real-time data processing, and scalable cloud deployment into a unified system.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This platform simulates a high-stakes coordination scenario where intelligent agents must:

- Generate contextual identities and assets using multimodal AI  
- Analyze geospatial and environmental data  
- Communicate across agent networks  
- Process incoming signals and system events  
- Coordinate group-level decisions in real time  

The system highlights:

- Multi-agent orchestration  
- Event-driven AI pipelines  
- Real-time participant tracking  
- Scalable cloud-native backend design  
- 3D interactive frontend visualization
