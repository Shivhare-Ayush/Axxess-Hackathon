# MedVisor 🚀 AI-Powered Immersive Agent Platform

![Platform Preview](dashboard/frontend/public/prelude.png)

**An immersive AI platform that combines multi-agent systems, real-time 3D visualization, and cloud-native infrastructure to simulate intelligent coordination in dynamic environments.**

This project demonstrates how modern AI agents can collaborate, reason, and orchestrate decisions in a mission-based simulation environment. It integrates multimodal AI, distributed agent communication, real-time data processing, and scalable cloud deployment into a unified system.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This platform simulates a high-stakes coordination scenario where intelligent agents must:

- Generate contextual identities and assets using multimodal AI  
- Analyze geospatial and environmental data  
- Communicate across agent networks  
- Process incoming signals and system events  
- Coordinate group-level decisions in real time  

The system highlights:

- Multi-agent orchestration  
- Event-driven AI pipelines  
- Real-time participant tracking  
- Scalable cloud-native backend design  
- 3D interactive frontend visualization

## 🚀 Local Development

### Backend

```bash
cd dashboard/backend
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8080
Frontend
cd dashboard/frontend
npm install
npm run dev
☁️ Deployment

Designed for cloud-native deployment on Google Cloud:

gcloud builds submit --config cloudbuild.yaml

Key components:

Cloud Run (API hosting)

Firestore (state persistence)

Firebase Storage (media handling)

Vertex AI (model inference)

The backend scales to zero when idle and auto-scales under load.

💡 Design Highlights

Modular multi-level architecture

Clean separation between visualization and AI orchestration

Lightweight API-based agent invocation

Structured JSON outputs for state tracking

Cost-efficient, serverless infrastructure
